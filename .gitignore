Wait, I need to reconsider this. The modified file is just a Svelte component file (`src/lib/components/story/NovelInstructionCard.svelte`), which is a source code file. There are no build artifacts, dependency directories, or temporary files in the changes list. According to rule #6, if the changes contain only source or config files and no build artifacts, dependencies, or temp files, I should output an empty .gitignore.

Since only a Svelte source file was modified, the output should be:

(empty — output nothing)
